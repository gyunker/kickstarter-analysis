# kickstarter-analysis

### Challenge
Question 1
- Data suggests that kickstarter campaigns with higher goals have lower success rates, with 40k to 45k being the exception
- I would caution the audience that there are a few number of kickstarter campaigns in the higher goal bands.  Additional data, perhaps from other subcategories, should be included prior to making generalities
