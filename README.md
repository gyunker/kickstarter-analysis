# kickstarter-analysis

### Challenge
Question 1
- Data suggests that kickstarter campaigns with higher goals have lower success rates and campaigns with the lowest goals have the highest success rates
- Campaigns with 40k to 45k appear to be an exception spurred by a low number of campaigns
- Caution should accompany this analysis as there are a few number of kickstarter campaigns in the higher goal bands.  
- Additional data, perhaps from other subcategories, should be included prior to making generalities about goal band success rates

Question 2
- Kickstarter theater campaigns are most popular in May, June and July; with May being the peak month
- Success rates are highest in May (should explore goal bands and theather subcategory to learn more)
- Note: there are years with partial data collected which influence the early and late months
